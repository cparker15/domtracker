# DOMTracker - a module tracker for your web browser #
##### by Josh Matthews - josh@joshmatthews.net - (jdm@github) #####

This project is an attempt to create a fully-functioning, cross-browser MOD tracker in Javascript that
emulates the look and feel of [OpenMPT](http://www.modplug.com/trackerinfo.html). Currently, it only works by default in Firefox.

Special thanks to the authors of [jsmodplayer](https://github.com/sneilan/jsmodplayer) for allowing
me to focus on the UI instead of writing sound code.
