# DOMTracker - a module tracker for your web browser #
##### by Josh Matthews - josh@joshmatthews.net - (jdm@github) #####

This project is an attempt to create a fully-functioning, cross-browser MOD tracker in Javascript that
emulates the look and feel of [OpenMPT](http://www.modplug.com/trackerinfo.html). Given its reliance on
the unstable audio and IndexedDB APIs, it's only tested in Firefox and Chrome.

Special thanks to the authors of:

* [jsmodplayer](https://github.com/sneilan/jsmodplayer)
* [audiolib.js](https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/audiolib.js)
* [IDBWrapper](https://github.com/jensarps/IDBWrapper)

without all of which this project would have been significantly harder.

The default module that loads is [sundance.mod by Purple Motion / Future Crew](http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=54405).

Please submit all bugs/feature requests to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jdm/domtracker/issues).
